Senior Product Manager building at the intersection of **fintech and commerce**

Currently at **POP**, focused on:
- Building **shopping experiences** that improve discovery → conversion → retention
- Creating the **payments → commerce flywheel** 
- Solving **customer-first CX** 
- Applying **AI** to solve real customer problems 

I enjoy **0→1 and 1→10** problems, working close to engineering + data, and turning messy inputs into clear execution.

### What I believe
- Clarity beats speed (and compounds)
- If you can’t measure it, you don’t understand it
- Most product problems are communication problems
- MVP should still be intentional

### Side interests
- AI-assisted product building
- Agentic commerce (practical, not hype)

Outside work: travel planning like a PM, game nights with unnecessary competitiveness and gym consistency (mostly) 

> Build things people actually use.
